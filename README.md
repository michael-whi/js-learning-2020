Choosing between a fucnction and a class we should consider them like a choice between stateless and stateful components, where a fucnction is stateless, while a class is statteful.

fucntions vs. classes diffs

|Fucntions | Classes|
|-|-|
|Hoisted | Not hoisted|
|Can be overwritten | Can't be overwritten|

Static methods can be called only from a class directly (not from an instance).
